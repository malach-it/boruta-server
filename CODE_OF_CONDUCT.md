# Code of Conduct

## 1. Why share this code of conduct?

A code of conduct aims to set the frame of community interactions around the corresponding open-source product. As collective work is at stake here, getting into it requires fitting the rules that make a safe and well-being place to work. This document aims the community wellness to give us the best opportunities to produce the relative facts and deliverables. From this perspective, the need for us to navigate with psychological safety is a must-have to deliver the best we can to improve and make evolve the code at the heart of the community.

## 2. What is a violation?

The purpose of this document is to set the limits and how to mitigate when violations occur. First of all, any violation of applicable law is to be reported for the healthiness of our interactions. We would make focus on harassment and all kind of discrimination against ancestry, age, color, religion, caste, origin, race, personal appearance, nationality, socio-economic status, level of experience, gender identity and expression, sex characteristics, ethnicity, sexual identity and orientation, visible or invisible disability, body size, and other private or personal information that can be used for harming purposes.

## 3. What is a contribution?

Are considered contributions, the produced code and all derived material propagated under the copyright provided by this repository of code. Other material out of this scope is not considered contributions to this project and we do have not any responsibility for them. Also, any official representation of the product may be considered as a contribution. Those need a written validation from the owners of the project.

## 4. In accordance with the product vision

The contributions to this project may fit its vision, all contributions that may diverge from it would be considered as violations if not consented by the owner. The vision of the project is stated as :

ENABLING ORGANIZATIONS THEN USERS TO MANAGE DIGITAL IDENTITIES WHERE DATA PROTECTION IMPROVE SYSTEMS SECURITY

## 5. The roles and responsibilities of contributors

Within this frame arise three main responsibilities. From those can be derived roles that have to fulfill all of them within the community. The objective of them is to help community wellness.

The first responsibility is to report violations that are described above (section 2). It is an overall member's duty to report such violations to the right person following an escalation process. That person will be named here as a facilitator of escalation, described next.

In order to facilitate escalation, the facilitator starts from report and assess the situation to find the right way to mitigate the issue. By owning the report, he keeps the process alive until its resolution by facilitating interactions with the mediating people. The best is to have a written trace of the way the situation was solved step by step to reproduce if it occurs again. He is also responsible for the escalation process improvement.

Within the community, mediation of the situations of violation is made by resolving the conflicts. The responsible person for this should be trained to conflict resolution using methods like Non-Violent Communication from Rosenberg or other peaceful ways of resolution. The responsibility includes finding external resources to solve the conflict, up to contact authorities in case of grave violation or violation of applicable law.

Once again, it is an overall responsibility to report the issues as it is the basis for a healthy community. Starting by navigating within the frame, ensuring psychological safety is also needed for us to evolve as a community.

For example, the minimal roles within a community around an open-source project start with an owner. The project owner can take both mediator and facilitator of escalation responsibilities. Those can be split then and spread across the community knowing that the responsibilities do not have to be unique within the community. Finding suitable roles according to the needed responsibilities of this framework is a work that may include community members to find a collective track toward them.

## 6. Escalation of violations

Based on IT incident report patterns, escalation of violations aims to find the root cause, fix the issue, and prevent its reappearance. Also, one of the objectives is to avoid conflict between parties and find equitable solutions to solve the issue. For that, the mediation may be made using methodology such as Non-Violent Communication to enforce communication over violence being factual as a basis.

The escalation process may suit the community integrating it, then as finding the roles, one may find a collective track to find the best way to mitigate issues. As a minimal process, the project owner must leave an explicit way to report abuse. As a reminder, it is an overall community member's responsibility to report violations of the present code of conduct. That report is to be done in an anonymous way to prevent retaliation. The people responsible for facilitation can keep track of the report, find the best people to mitigate it within the community (it can be himself), and the mediation can begin.

Then comes the mediation, for a low-importance violation, the mediator can facilitate communication and take action against the abuse. In case of public violation, the impactful content is to be removed. Actions may be temporary or permanent bans from the community for example. The issue of the mediation may be tracked by the facilitator for audit purposes but also to mediate if the violation comes up again. That record may be public or private. He can also find ways to improve the escalation process or trigger a role redefinition within the community.

In case of grave violation like any against applicable law, the authorities are to be warned and the overall community has the duty to facilitate their work.

## 7. Ethical goals

This frame of contributions may help to promote ethical goals. Before this, contributions may not imply in any manner a step against those goals, knowing that going toward them aims for us to live in a better place which is the purpose of the current document. This community aims to:

- fight against slavery and forced labor, empower labor law
- empower human rights
- empower diversity, equity, and inclusion

The frame helps to have the tools to get mutual aid to go toward those goals.
